# Setup pstack

Write `~/.kiro/steering/pstack-models.md`, an always-applied steering file that sets pstack's model per role.

## Steps

### 1. Detect available models

Enumerate the model ids you can pass to a `subagent` stage in this session. That is the dependable source. Kiro also exposes `/model` for the models the user is entitled to; prefer it for completeness. If you cannot detect any, ask the user to paste the ids they have access to. Never write a real id you have not confirmed is available. The aliases `inherit-parent` and `auto` are always valid even though they are not detected ids.

### 2. Load current state

The default role-to-model mapping is the rule shape shown in step 5 below. If `~/.kiro/steering/pstack-models.md` already exists, read it and treat its `# budget` line and its role values as the current choices. Otherwise start from those defaults. A line whose role is not in step 5, such as `how critics`, is from a retired role. Drop it.

### 3. Budget, map, and confirm

**(a) Ask for a budget.** Ask in prose. Offer these four options with these exact labels, and name the current budget when the rule records one. With no rule, say that `large` matches the skill defaults.

- `unlimited — max reasoning`
- `large — xhigh reasoning`
- `medium — high reasoning`
- `small — medium reasoning`

**(b) Apply it.** Build the working table from the skill defaults, and on a re-run keep any role you changed by family, list, or alias (`inherit-parent`, `auto`). The budget sets a reasoning target for every role. Kiro model ids do not carry an effort token the way Cursor slugs did, so the budget maps as follows. If the user picked a specific detected id for a role, keep it. Otherwise set the role to `auto` so it runs on the parent chat model at whatever reasoning the session already uses. Record the chosen budget label on the `# budget` line for the next run to read. When the user does name real detected ids, honor them verbatim; the budget only governs the `auto` fallback and the recorded label.

**(c) Show the roles and confirm.** Show every role with its model, marking any real model id not in the detected set as needing a choice. Also list each line step 2 dropped. Ask in prose whether to accept as-is or change specific roles, offering the detected models plus `inherit-parent` and `auto` (both mean: this role runs on the parent chat model, which is how Auto users stay on Auto) as the options. For panel roles (arena runners, architect runners, interrogate reviewers) the value is a list, and one subagent runs per entry, alias entries included, so the list length sets the count. `arena cross-judge pool` is also a list, but Arena selects one value from it whose model family differs from the parent's when possible. `swarm workers` is the default model for every worker unless a race or comparison assigns another model per arm.

### 4. Validate

Every real model id written must be in the detected set. `inherit-parent` and `auto` always pass. If a chosen real model id is not available, stop and ask again.

### 5. Write the rule

Write `~/.kiro/steering/pstack-models.md` with `inclusion: always`, a `# budget` line with the chosen label and its target effort, and one line per role, using the same labels poteto-mode uses. Overwrite the whole file so re-runs stay idempotent. The model ids below are the original Cursor-harness defaults. On Kiro, keep them only if they are detected ids; otherwise use `auto` so the role runs on the parent chat model. Shape:

### 6. Confirm

Tell the user the rule was written and that it applies to new sessions. Re-running this skill updates it.

### 7. Offer a verification skill (optional)

Check whether the project has a way to drive the real app for proof (a `verify-*` skill, or an existing harness). If not, offer once: "want a project-local verification skill, so agents can drive the app the way a user does and prove changes work? I can generate one with /create-verification-skill." On yes, invoke `/create-verification-skill` (resolves wherever pstack is installed: workspace, user, or plugin). On no, move on without pushing.
